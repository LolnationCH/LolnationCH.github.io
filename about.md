I am a student in computer science at university (almost done).

I love pretty much any subject in computer related, apart maybe the too much calculus ones (like graphics).

The subjects I prefer are :
- Security
- AI
- Application programming
- Reverse engineering

I can program in :
- Python
- C/C++
- C#/WPF
- JS/React/Html
- Assembly (Sparc 9 and NES, little bit 8086)
- COBOL, EasyTrieve
- Powershell, Bash/Zsh/sh
- Java (unfortunaly)
